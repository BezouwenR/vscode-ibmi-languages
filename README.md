# vscode-ibmi-languages

Somewhat decent syntax highlighting for IBMi languages such as RPG, CL, DDS, and MI.

I made this extension because I do a lot more reading than writing with IBMi languages.
I respect the legacy of the green screen, but I needed some syntax highlighting in my life; my brain is too small.

Inspired and derived from an existing RPG extension https://github.com/NielsLiisberg/RPG-for-VSCode .
Without this brilliant guy, I wouldn't have thought to start working on this.



## Features
* Syntax highlighting for RPG/400
* Syntax highlighting for RPGLE fixed/free
* Syntax highlighting for Control Language (CL) - Both CLLE and CL
* Syntax highlighting for Machine Interface (MI)
* Syntax highlighting for physical and logical files (.pf and .lf)


## Stretch Features
Every project starts out fun, but later becomes stale, we'll see if I get here.

* Syntax highlighting for display files (.dspf)
* Syntax highlighting for printer files (.prtf)
* Syntax highlighting for system 38 RPG (.rpg38)
* Syntax highlighting for system 38 logical and physicals (.lf38) and (.pf38)
